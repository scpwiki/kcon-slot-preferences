KCON SLOT PREFERENCES WEB PAGE
==============================

Static website to provide a display utility for authors' slot preferences, backed by a parser for this new syntax.

EXAMPLES:

You can specify a list of particular numbers:

    5005, 5117, 5761

You can also use parentheses or brackets to group choices if you wish:

    [5010, 5015, 5020]

    (5001, 5002, 5003), (5100, 5200, 5300)

This also supports PATTERNS. All patterns require an order ("lowest" or "highest"), followed by a pattern type ("fixed" or "incremental"). For instance:

    lowest fixed 5XXX
    highest incremental 5XXX

There are also aliases:

    lowest, smallest
    highest, biggest, largest

    fixed, same
    incremental, sequential, incr, seq

First, to explain ordering. Let us assume INCREMENTAL patterns:

    smallest seq 5XXX
    largest seq 5XXX

The first will make a list starting with 5001, 5002, 5003, etc.
The second will make a list starting with 5999, 5998, 5997, etc.

This treats all the Xs as a series of digits to be filled in order, thus the name "incremental" or "sequential".

There are also FIXED patterns. These require that all placeholder digits have the same value.
To illustrate, consider these two patterns:

    lowest incr 5XXX
    lowest fixed 5XXX

The first makes a list starting with 5001, 5002, 5003, 5004, 5005 etc.
The second makes a list starting with 5111, 5222, 5333, 5444, 5555, etc.

Note that there are many fewer fixed options. By definition, for any given pattern, there can be at most 10 variants emitted.

All patterns must explicitly specify if they are INCREMENTAL or FIXED.

Each kind of specifier can be composed. So the following are all valid syntax:

    (highest incr 599X, 5002), 5022, lowest fixed 5XX0

    5013, 5017, 5019, 5023, 5027

    [smallest seq 500X, smallest seq 50X0, smallest seq 5X00], 5999, (5107, 5170)

    5007, highest same 5X72, 5201, lowest same 50XX

Note that when executing parseAndListPreferences() or listPreferences(), you can pass in a list of unavailable slots. This is useful for instance, for blocking the X000 slot itself (since it is always the first-place prize, or for 9kon, blocking 9999).

In particular, this is useful for actual slot assignment - at the conclusion of a contest, you run through each article by score order and add all slots which have already been taken by higher winners.

If the function emits an empty list, then that means that the user did not provide enough preferences and a slot will have to be assigned for them.

DEVELOPMENT:

Set up dependencies:

    npm install

If you modify parser.ne, then generate a new parser.js:
Note, this file should not be modified manually, it is autogenerated!

    npm run build

Then, you can try out the parser locally:

    npm run test 'highest fixed 50XX, 5001'
